# Rebus
Chrome extension that translates the text on a website into images using Google Image Search, like a Rebus.
Google search contains a model of our culture and way of thinking and this project is a reflection on that. We wanted to explore just how injective "Google's search function" is.That is, if given a word, Google provides images that represent it, that are symbols for it, how easy is it to guess the word, given the image? 
The project developed at Exile Game Jam with the theme "Not a Game" over the course of two days.
# Use intructions
On any* website, click on the extension icon that will be added to the Chrome toolbar to translate the website to images.

* Works best on websites with simple structure and mosntly text based content.

Currently not fully functional due to recent changes to Google's search engine API.
